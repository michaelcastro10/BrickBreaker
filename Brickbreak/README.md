### Running the Program

Main class: Game.java

Data files needed: 
- They are all in Assets.

Key/Mouse inputs:
- Right arrow Key to move to the Right
- left arrow Key to move to the Left

Cheat keys: 
- E to end the game
- I to return to intro screen
- Space to start game when in intro screen

Known Bugs:
- the ball does not have a "natural" bounce
- the ball bounces in really fast bursts â€“ even though it can seem like an intentional bounce due to 
the theme

Extra credit:
- Other than making the "life" of each brick equal to the value of the level, I did not 
get the opportunity to do more.


### Notes

After this project, I learned than sometimes my goals will not be met. Need to set realistic ones.


### Impressions

Loved it. I learned so much.
