This project implements the game of Breakout.

Name: Michael Castro
Quick Comments: 
- Right arrow Key to move to the Right
- left arrow Key to move to the Left
- E to end the game
- I to return to intro screen
- Space to start game when in intro screen
- Other than making the "life" of each brick equal to the value of the level, I did not 
get the opportunity to do more.
